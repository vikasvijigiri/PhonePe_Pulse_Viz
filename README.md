## About

This project aims to provide a visual representation of PhonePe Pulse data using GeoMaps from Plotly. It leverages Streamlit, a popular Python library for creating web applications with minimal effort. The application dynamically connects to a MySQL database to fetch the latest data and visualize it on the GeoMaps.
